pytest --maxfail=2 -m "regression" --template=html1/index.html --report=report.html

Stop at first failure:
pytest -x

Allow max failure before stopping:
pytest --maxfail=2

Run single test:
pytest -k test_func_name

Run a single file:

Re-Run all tests , starting with last failed:
pytest --ff

you can combine CLI operations together:
pytest -ff -x -v
